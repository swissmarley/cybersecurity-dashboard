## Features

- **IP Lookup**: Lookup detailed information about an IP address using the IP-API service.
- **Port Scanning**: Scan ports for a given host using the ViewDNS API.
- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Scan for vulnerabilities using the VulDB API with a query for specific software vulnerabilities.
- **Malware Analysis**: Upload a file for analysis via Falcon Sandbox API, and retrieve detailed scan results.
- **Tool Usage Analytics**: Visualize the usage statistics of different tools with a dynamically updating bar chart.
- **Recent Activity**: View the latest activity logs for each tool, providing insights into recent scans and lookups.

## Usage

Once the server is running, open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000`. 

The dashboard will display the following tools:

- IP Lookup: Enter an IP address to get detailed information.

- Port Scanning: Enter a domain to scan for open ports.

- Vulnerability Scanning: Enter a software name (e.g., 
"Microsoft Windows") to scan for known vulnerabilities.

- Malware Analysis: Upload a file to be analyzed for potential threats. You'll receive the result after processing.

### Malware Analysis Flow

- File Upload: Choose a file to upload.
- Analysis: The file is submitted for analysis via the Falcon Sandbox API.
- Result Fetching: After the file is processed, the result is retrieved via the sha256 hash, showing detailed analysis including whether the file is malicious, the behavior of the file, and other critical information.


## API Keys

This app requires several API keys to interact with external services. You will need to sign up for the following services and obtain your keys:

- [IP-API](http://ip-api.com/): For IP lookup.

- [ViewDNS](https://viewdns.info/api/): For port scanning.

- [VulDB](https://vuldb.com/): For vulnerability scanning.

- [Falcon-Sandbox](https://www.hybrid-analysis.com/docs/api/v2): For malware analysis.

## File Upload

Malware analysis involves uploading files to Falcon Sandbox for analysis. The file is temporarily stored on the server and sent to the Falcon Sandbox API. Once the analysis is complete, the file is deleted from the server.

### File Upload Guidelines:
- Supported file types: The app supports common file types for analysis (e.g., .exe, .dll, .pdf, etc.).

- File size limit: Ensure the file size is within Falcon Sandboxâ€™s upload limits (usually 50MB or less).
